# Tweelection
The purpose of this university project is to predict the outcome of the French election by analysing tweets.

We build this application in Java. We used a Bag of word machine learning model to make the tweet classifier.
And we had an accuracy on the training set of 78%.
We train the model on 30 000 Amazon reviews, scraped with a Node.js server.
